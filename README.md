# notoj

A keyboard-driven terminal notes app. Search, create, and browse plain-text markdown notes without leaving the terminal.

## Install

After setting up GitHub SSH access on the machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:chkiss/Notoj.git ~/Notoj
bash ~/Notoj/install.sh && source ~/.bashrc
```

`install.sh` creates `~/.local/bin` if needed, symlinks the script, adds it to `$PATH`, and installs a shell function that auto-updates the repo on each launch. Safe to run multiple times — skips steps already done.

## First launch

Run `notoj` and it will walk you through setup:

1. **Notes directory** — enter the path where your notes live (created if it doesn't exist)
2. **Simplenote import** — if the directory is empty, you'll be offered the option to import from a Simplenote JSON export:

```
notoj: no notes directory configured.
Notes directory [~/notes]: ~/my-notes

Notes directory is empty. Import from a Simplenote export? [y/N] y
Path to Simplenote export directory: ~/Downloads/simplenote-export
  notes.json  →  my-first-note.md
  ...
42 note(s) converted

[notoj launches]
```

The notes directory is saved to `~/.config/notoj/config`. Neither prompt appears again once notes exist.

## Usage

```
notoj
```

```
notoj --help
```

## Note format

Notes are plain markdown files with a YAML frontmatter block:

```markdown
---
id: <uuid>
created: 2025-01-01T12:00:00Z
modified: 2025-01-01T12:00:00Z
title: My note title
tags:
  - example
---

First line becomes the title.

Body text here. Use #hashtags inline — they are automatically
synced to the frontmatter tags field.
```

The filename is derived from the first line of the body. Renaming a note (editing its first line) renames the file automatically.

## Sync and conflicts

notoj works well with Syncthing. External edits are detected and reloaded automatically. Syncthing sync-conflict files are detected and surfaced in the header; press `c` to resolve them in vimdiff.

A local git repository is maintained in the notes directory for snapshot history. Every edit, create, trash, restore, and conflict resolution is committed automatically.

## Philosophy

- Retrieval over organization — search replaces folders
- Plain files — notes are readable and editable by any tool
- Offline-first — no cloud dependency
- External-tool friendly — Vim, Syncthing, and CLI workflows all work naturally
